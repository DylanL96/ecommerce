Created a full-stack shopping cart that allows users to perform CRUD funcionality with their shopping cart.
For instance, users can add, delete and edit items in their shopping carts. I used an in-memory database (H2) to hold all of the items that users may want to add to their shopping carts. Users are encouraged to register to get a 10% discount when purchasing their groceries.

This project helped me understand Spring Security and sessions a lot more and I incorporated Spring Security to help with authorization and authenticated paths, access to different resources within the website. I used sessions to allow users to be able to potentially grab their previous orders if they wish to do so.
